    <td>Finding those who are physically around you that have similar interests is not as simple as it should be. Current platforms don't emphasize the power of localization in digital communication where it could be used to augment and improve the experience drastically. With modern Social Media, we are more connected than ever but for many, it is very isolating. Social Media is an integral part of society and making it feel less isolating but having it open new opportunity to meet others is what the problem is.</td>
    <td>Our solution to this problem is to leverage all of the data that we have our disposal with modern technology such as location and interest data to help people find those around them that have similar interests and that are located around them so there is potential to meet with the people they find. Having your communication circle localized makes finding groups of others fun and rewarding because you could make a new friend in the real world as opposed to just online. While location groups are a big focus displaying localized news, events, and all forms of media can greatly increase one's awareness of what's going on around them as well as other places.</td>

    <td>The College Student demographic is a massive market with around 16 million students in the US alone. College students tend to be early adopters that have high social media usage. Apps like Discord and Slack that are targeting very specific demographics gaming and enterprise respectfully have users that use these tools but are not in their target demographic we want to make something that attracts them. Those who use iMessage and don't own all Apple devices and want to have a unified communication experience fall into our target demographic. Those who don't have any apple product and would like a service that does everything that iMessage does and more for devices they own fall into our target demographic. We will also target enterprise users eventually. Essentially anyone that wants a robust way of communicating with others digitally is our target demographic.</td>
    <td> There are many apps that are doing something similar to what we are trying to do. Yik Yak was a prominent example of something very similar. Discord, Slack, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp. All of these apps have many unique features but none of them is a complete package for every individual. Our app will include every feature as well as being on every platform.</td>

    <td>Sales channels will need to be the least intrusive way to generate revenue through the platform while not getting in the way of the core service. Special packages could be bought such as animated profile pictures, enterprise versions of the software, etc.</td>
    <td>Marketing is going to be a challenge because there are so many platforms that don't have good rollouts and fail altogether. A full sales plan will be created after we have slightly more to work with but for the time being here is the barebones plan. After we have something we are proud of we do a limited rollout to a small metro area for testing to see how we can market such as billboards, word of mouth, online advertising, and other forms of promotion. Once we find a strategy that works try to replicate these efforts on a large scale. </td>

    <td>Expenses include hosting costs for the backend. Most things at this point are free such as the tools we are using Trello, Slack, Gitlab. We are also not going to receive profit until we are making money (Agreements will be renegotiated before them). At this point, there are not many expenses</td>
