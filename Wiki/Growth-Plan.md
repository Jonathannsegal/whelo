    <td>Networks thrive off the connection. Connection occurs when people discover similarity. Finding those connections who are physically around you that have similar interests is not as simple as it should be. The similarity is making connections with others over what makes you who you are: 
   <ul>
      <li>your interests ("you like pizza? so do I!")</li>
      <li>you background ("you're from Des Moines? so am I!")</li>
      <li>your pet peeves ("I can't stand the cold midwest winters!")</li>
      <li>your thoughts ("Have you ever thought why the sky is blue?")</li>
   </ul>
    Current platforms don't emphasize the power of localization in digital communication where it could be used to augment and improve the experience drastically. With modern Social Media, we are more connected than ever but for many, it is very isolating. Social Media is an integral part of society and making it feel less isolating but having it open new opportunity to meet others is what the problem is.</td>
    <td>Our solution to this problem is to leverage all of the data that we have our disposal with modern technology such as location and interest data to help people find those around them that have similar interests and that are located around them so there is potential to meet with the people they find. Having your communication circle localized makes finding groups of others fun and rewarding because you could make a new friend in the real world as opposed to just online. While location groups are a big focus displaying localized news, events, and all forms of media can greatly increase one's awareness of what's going on around them as well as other places. Sharing can be categorized into four types of information:
    <ul>
      <li>Sentiment</li>
      <li>Thoughts</li>
      <li>Intrests</li>
      <li>Facts</li>
   </ul>
   Posted content tends to be more temporary or permanent, specific or general
   The product architechture must encourage creation and engagement:
   <ul>
      <li>With content</li>
      <li>Within the community</li>
   </ul>
   Product features must encourage the creation of great content by making it:
    <ul>
      <li>Simple to create (frictionless)</li>
      <li>Delightful to create (rewarding)</li>
      <li>Interesting to create (variable)</li>
   </ul>
   To avoid getting trapped in the echo chamber of content we must encourage a diversity of content. More content, more opportunities for people to discover similarities. More similarities, more engagment. A mix of permanent and temporary content is key to making it engaging and rewarding.

   Fuel Discovery with content Categories
   Since content diversity is important in generating new ideas and higher-quality content having categories can fuel user growth:
   <ul>
      <li>Location: local news and polls to help locals connect over regional information</li>
      <li>Featured: Featured topics and categories can be made by anylizing data on topics that generate most engagment within the platform as well as others ie (Instagram and Buzfeed)</li>
      <li>Intrests</li>
   </ul>
   Here are some categories that we can have we can alwayse add more.

   Having the platform utilizes local events will also be key to engagement because the platform is location-based bringing awareness to the platform and the event will be useful to fuel the user base.

   Creating a system for rewarding those who utilize the platform will be key to generating loyalty and a strong user base. Examples could be giving swag to top users of the platform such as stickers, t-shirts, etc. Another reward could be premium features such as custom themes and turning off ads.

    <td>The College Student demographic is a massive market with around 16 million students in the US alone. College students tend to be early adopters that have high social media usage. Apps like Discord and Slack that are targeting very specific demographics gaming and enterprise respectfully have users that use these tools but are not in their target demographic we want to make something that attracts them. Those who use iMessage and don't own all Apple devices and want to have a unified communication experience fall into our target demographic. Those who don't have any apple product and would like a service that does everything that iMessage does and more for devices they own fall into our target demographic. We will also target enterprise users eventually. Essentially anyone that wants a robust way of communicating with others digitally is our target demographic. Because of the specific targeting by location and interest, this platform could be strongly pitched to advertisers because of the plethora of specific groups that the platform will be able to offer advertisers.</td>
    <td> There are many apps that are doing something similar to what we are trying to do. Yik Yak was a prominent example of something very similar. Discord, Slack, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp. All of these apps have many unique features but none of them is a complete package for every individual. Our app will include every feature as well as being on every platform.</td>

    <td>Sales channels will need to be the least intrusive way to generate revenue through the platform while not getting in the way of the core service. Special packages could be bought such as animated profile pictures, enterprise versions of the software, etc. A sales strategy is also to utilize location data and make a way for small local businesses to advertise to those interested in specific things and that are physically in the range of the store, instead of relying on general data and broad advertising more personalized and location-based marketing from businesses will make the platform feel personal.
    The three main paths to Monetization are:

   Contexual advertising is a big part of the revenue model because location based advertizing is growing tremendously. Our platform will have these key intrests to advertizers.
   <ul>
      <li>Content - what people are talking about and how they feel about it</li>
      <li>Hyperlocality - Where people are and what places they might be close to</li>
      <li>Trends - Changes in what people talk about and how they feel over time</li>
      <li>Community - Social platforms rely on network effects and the vitality of community.</li>

    <td>Marketing is going to be a challenge because there are so many platforms that don't have good rollouts and fail altogether. A full sales plan will be created after we have slightly more to work with but for the time being here is the barebones plan. After we have something we are proud of we do a limited rollout to a small metro area for testing to see how we can market such as billboards, word of mouth, online advertising, and other forms of promotion. Once we find a strategy that works try to replicate these efforts on a large scale. </td>
