# Standard Operating Procedure

Everyone will be busy over the summer with work/ internships this in regards to work for this company you should be putting in at least a few hours a week and in regards to when you work on it its whenever you have time either find an issue to fix or a feature to implement.

essentially this is a long term hackathon project

## Process
We are going to be using kanban, here is a site that explains what we are doing https://blog.hubstaff.com/kanban-with-trello/

How this is going to work is when you are working on the projects you will either choose a feature to implement and add it to the relevant trello board with pertaining information or look through the trello boards and work on an existing feature or issue.

These trello tasks can be tied to merge requests which is a good way to keep track of what is currently being done, who is doing what, and what needs to be done.
