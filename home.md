# Standard Operating Procedure

Everyone will be busy over the summer with work/ internships this in regards to work for this company you should be putting in at least a few hours a week and in regards to when you work on it its whenever you have time either find an issue to fix or a feature to implement.

essentially this is a long term hackathon project

## Process
We are going to be using kanban, here is a site that explains what we are doing https://blog.hubstaff.com/kanban-with-trello/

How this is going to work is when you are working on the projects you will either choose a feature to implement and add it to the relevant trello board with pertaining information or look through the trello boards and work on an existing feature or issue.

These trello tasks can be tied to merge requests which is a good way to keep track of what is currently being done, who is doing what, and what needs to be done.

# Plan of Action (Plan till launch)
This is going to be a step by step process on how we are going to further the product.

1. Start creating the website in react
    * user login
    * Work on the peer to peer messaging system first
2. Create a backend
    * database for data and users
    * user creation
    * find a framework to render everything serverside and just serve the application to the user.
    * Connect the database with the front end client
3. Make groups for multiple users
    * add features to groups
    * add customizability to groups
    * add location data to groups
4. Create a location-based way to add new users and through a special code (a way that requires the two users to know each other)

5. Create a map based global feel function that sorts data by location
    * map that you can find a certain area to look through data
    * interface to see data from location
6. Modify the project for other platforms
    * Windows store app
    * Mac app store
    * Android - Google Play
    * IOS - app store
7. Create user data information
    * user data
    * customizability
    * followers
    * story
    * etc
8. Incorporate as an LLC in Deleware

9. Test with a limited number of users to see how the app is being used
    * based on user feedback make additional updates to the system.
