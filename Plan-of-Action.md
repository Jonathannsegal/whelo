# Plan for Summer 2019
This is going to be a step by step process on how we are going to further the product.

1. Start creating the website in react
    * user login
    * Work on the peer to peer messaging system first
2. Create a backend
    * database for data and users
    * user creation
    * find a framework to render everything serverside and just serve the application to the user.
    * Connect the database with the front end client
3. Make groups for multiple users
    * add features to groups
    * add customizability to groups
    * add location data to groups
4. Create a location-based way to add new users and through a special code (a way that requires the two users to know each other)

5. Create a map based global feel function that sorts data by location
    * map that you can find a certain area to look through data
    * interface to see data from location
6. Modify the project for other platforms
    * Windows store app
    * Mac app store
    * Android - Google Play
    * IOS - app store
7. Create user data information
    * user data
    * customizability
    * followers
    * story
    * etc
8. Incorporate as an LLC

9. Create a Sales and Marketing team
    * work on a plan to advertize the product

10. Test with a limited number of users to see how the app is being used
    * based on user feedback make additional updates to the system.
