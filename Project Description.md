The personal section is a standard peer to peer texting/ communication thread

### Local
The local section is where groups live. Groups are primarily baced on intrest and location, for example the groups can be as specific as those taking English 150 at Iowa State University and only those physically at Iowa State would be able to join. Groups can be set to remove users if they leave the defined area or not to. Groups could also be as generic as everyone who likes programing, this group would determine the closest people up to a certian number that could join based on proximity, for example if a user made this group in San Fransisco, California the group geographical radius might be a few miles, whereas somone in Cedar Rapids, Iowa might be a few hundred miles. 

### Global
A feed that is localized in a certian region. Users can add only to the feed in their own region but are able to see other regions. User can upload multiple types of data.
